Welcome to VirtualHub Setup! Here we will set up our system to follow the VirtualHub tutorials.

So, what are we going to do? First, we will install Kubuntu to dual-boot with Windows. You can escape this step if you are already on a Linux system. If you don’t know what Kubuntu or Linux is, don’t worry, I will explain everything.

Then we will install several software for working with the tutorials posted on [VirtualHub](https://virtualhub.eu.org).
