Welcome to VirtualHub Setup! Here we will set up our system to follow the [VirtualHub](https://virtualhub.eu.org) tutorials.

VirtualHub Setup is a static site and it is fast. While VirtualHub is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), this site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Initially, VirtualHub was a single website, meant to complement the Legacy Installer website. You can still visit the old website here: <https://old.virtualhub.eu.org>. Now, VirtualHub is a platform of many different websites complementing each other. VirtualHub Setup is one of those sites.

Instead of using Windows to write the tutorials and make the videos for VirtualHub, I will use different Linux distributions. You do not need to worry about it. This website is here to help you install a good Linux Distribution for beginners,  [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org), and also help you install the software required to follow VirtualHub tutorials on it. You can keep your Windows installation and dual boot. I will use Kubuntu for all the videos from now on. If you want, you can continue using Windows but the steps may need to be modified for you. For emulators and other software that do not have a Linux version or if the Linux version does not work properly, I will use [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/) to run them.

I am also introducing several other websites which will be available soon:

- [VirtualHub Blog](https://blog.virtualhub.eu.org) - The story about VirtualHub.
- [VirtualHub Screenshots](https://screenshots.virtualhub.eu.org) - Screenshots of old Software.
- [VirtualHub DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.virtualhub.eu.org) - Installing old software directly on DOSBox-X.
