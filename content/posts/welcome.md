Welcome to VirtualHub Setup! Here we will setup our system in order to follow the VirtualHub tutorials.

So, what are we going to do? First we will install Kubuntu to dual-boot with Windows. You can escape this step if you are already on a Linux system. If you don't know what Kubuntu or Linux is, don't worry, I will explain everything.

Then we will install several software for working with the tutorials posted on [VirtualHub](https://virtualhub.eu.org).

## What will we install??

- VirtualBox
- VMware Player
- QEMU
- GNOME Boxes
- Virt-manager
- QtEMU
- AQEMU
- 86Box
- PCem
- DOSBox
- DOSBox-Staging
- DOSBox-X
- Bochs
- MAME

We will also tweak an tune everything to suit our needs. Every post will be accompanied by a video tutorial.

## How is it different from the posts on Legacy Installer website?

The content on Legacy Installer website is outdated. It is very difficult for me to update and maintain it due to the very nature of WordPress. Here, not only I will provide tutorials but I will also keep them up to date. Also, I love starting things anew. 

## When are you starting?

I will start posting tutorials from tomorrow. But unlike my last promise, I will not be able to post tutorials daily. You can expect at least two tutorials every week.

Stay tuned!
